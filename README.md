# Online Hangman Game

This ReactJS App was made using React and Redux. It is an online version of the classic game of hangman.

# Description of project

I built this ReactJS app as part of a web development bootcamp. This was one of the projects within the course and it required me to use React and Redux Toolkit.

# Installation

The easiest way to use the App is to download the zip file, by clicking on the "Code" button and then selecting "download Zip". Once you have downloaded the file, you need to unzip the folder and save in a file on your local machine.

Open a new terminal and navigate to the file you have just saved on your local machine. In the project directory, run `npm install` and `npm install --save @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`. This will ensure you have the correct node packages required to run the App. 

Once the node files are installed, navigate to the file you have saved on your local machine and in the project directory run `npm start`.

The App should now automatically open in your browser, but you can view it in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

# Rules of the game

- Aim: To correctly guess the unknown word. Each blank space (underscore) is where there should be a letter, and you need to guess which letter should be there.

- Warning: You can only pick an incorrect letter ten times.

- To start, click the 'New Game' button at the bottom of the screen.
- To guess a letter, click it on the screen.
- If you guess one of the letters in the word, the blank space will change into that letter.
- If you guess incorrectly, then an image is displayed to show you your 'score'.
- If you mangage to guess all of the letters in the word correctly (and before 10 incorrect guesses), then you win!
- If you pick an incorrect letter ten times, then an image will be displayed and you lose!
